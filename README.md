# etch-a-sketch
This will be my first big project! Wish me luck!

This project is from the Odin Project and it will have all the material it has taught me for Javascript, how to use loops, arrays, and DOM manipulation.
I started The Odin Project course in January of 2024, it is currently February 26th, 2024 and this will be all the HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I've learned so far.


This Etch-a-sketch will have a ton of DOM manipulation and CSS.
